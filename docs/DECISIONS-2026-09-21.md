# Decisions — 2026-09-21

## 1. Understand-Anything assessed — not adopted, one bounded trial offered

The guild lead: *"I know we're doing a lot to help people understand things, but
please look at this."* — `github.com/Egonex-AI/Understand-Anything`, MIT
(© Yuxiang Lin and Infinite Universe, Inc.), a Claude Code plugin that builds a
knowledge graph of a codebase and serves an interactive dashboard over it.
Reported at ~83k stars; ⚠ **unverified from here** — this session's GitHub access
is scoped to our own repository, so that figure comes from the project's own page
and a third-party index, not the API.

### What it is
Tree-sitter for the structural half (files, functions, classes, imports,
inheritance) plus a **seven-agent LLM pipeline** for the semantic half:
plain-English per-file summaries, architectural layer assignment, business-domain
mapping, and dependency-ordered guided tours. Writes `.ua/knowledge-graph.json`
(+ `config.json`, `intermediate/`, `diff-overlay.json`) into the repo. Commands:
`/understand`, `-dashboard`, `-chat`, `-diff`, `-explain`, `-domain`,
`-knowledge`.

### ⚠ We already own the deterministic half of this, on purpose
**`scripts/graphify.sh`**, adopted 2026-09-13 (`DECISIONS-2026-09-10.md`). Same
tree-sitter core, **code-only — no LLM, no API key**: 10,340 nodes · 20,185 edges
· 695 communities, rebuild in ~30s, outputs gitignored. The guild lead's call then
was *"regen script in, outputs out, hook not installed"* — the hook specifically
because *"'query the graph before reading files' is the opposite of the lesson
that week (read the block, not the hits)."*

So the question is not "is a code graph useful", which is settled. It is narrower:
**does the LLM layer answer what the graph alone could not?** That test already
exists — the four real problems of that week:

| Problem | Graph? | Would the LLM layer? |
|---|---|---|
| The relay leak — a payload field one process never sent | no (invisible to a call graph) | **no** — it summarises files, it does not diff a data contract across an HTTP boundary |
| Quiet-mode split — one config key through 16 gates | no (zero nodes for `quietMode`) | **maybe** — semantic search over summaries could surface it. But `grep quietMode` already does, in a second, for nothing |
| The `#if 0` miss | no (tree-sitter does not evaluate the preprocessor) | marginal — an LLM reading the file might notice |
| Target-of-target | no — grep + `HOW-ITS-BUILT.md` did it | no |

**One of four, and that one is already a one-second grep.** That is the whole
case against wiring it in.

### What it would genuinely add, and why the timing is not silly
Per-file plain-English summaries, semantic search, a domain view, and
**dependency-ordered guided tours**. Those are *onboarding* features, not
maintenance ones — and onboarding just became a real concern rather than a
hypothetical: the relicense to AGPL, `DESIGN-guild-kit.md`, and the brochure aimed
at other guilds all assume an outside maintainer eventually lands on an 18k-line
`index.js` and a 35k-line agent. Nothing we have is a *reading order*.
`CLAUDE.md` is a map and `HOW-ITS-BUILT.md` is an index; neither says "start here,
then this."

### ⚠ Why it does not go in as-is — four repo-specific hazards
1. **It generates a second architectural authority.** `CLAUDE.md` says at the top
   that it is the authority, and it is hand-maintained precisely because the
   corrections are load-bearing and invisible to a generator: the Zeal spawn-id
   boundary is **superseded** and says so, Supabase is **Pro, not free tier**,
   historical chat is *collection in scope, display not*, Discord is *no longer*
   a source of truth. An LLM summarising this repo will restate the stale version
   of every one of those, confidently. This is the same trap already recorded for
   `/impeccable init`: *"Three competing doc roots is how the next session reads
   the wrong one."*
2. **`--auto-update` is a post-commit hook** that re-analyses changed files on
   every commit. `main` runs 12–42 commits/day. That is a recurring LLM spend
   attached to `git commit`, and it is the same hook-shaped thing already declined
   for graphify.
3. **Cost, at a moment we are counting it.** Its own README warns the first run
   *"can consume a significant number of tokens on large projects"* and gives no
   figure. Our large project is two monoliths, `web/`, Mimic, 236 migrations and
   246 test files. `COSTS.md` puts development tooling at ~5× infrastructure and
   exists to justify donations; an unbounded number does not belong in it.
4. **Install method.** The README offers `curl -fsSL … | bash` and
   `iwr -useb … | iex`. Use neither. The marketplace route
   (`/plugin marketplace add`) is the supported one — and note a plugin install
   does **not** survive a fresh cloud container, which is exactly why `impeccable`
   and `ponytail` were *vendored into committed `.claude/skills/`* instead.

Licence is the one clean part: **MIT**, so vendoring a piece of it is permitted
and compatible with our AGPL.

### The call
**Not adopted.** Same verdict and the same reasoning as `rtk` and
`ui-ux-pro-max-skill` on 2026-09-13: a good tool that overlaps something we
already decided the shape of.

**The one trial worth running**, if the guild lead wants it: point it at
**`packages/wolfpack-logsync/` alone** — one self-contained surface, no bot, no
web, no Mimic — and compare its guided tour against that surface's
`HOW-ITS-BUILT.md` rows. Bounded spend, and a clear pass/fail: *does it say
anything the index does not?* If yes, the output is a **draft for a human to
edit into `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a new onboarding doc** — never a generated file
committed as an authority, and never the auto-update hook.
⚠ A cloud session cannot run this: `/plugin` is a CLI command, and the container
is ephemeral. It is a desktop-session job.

## 2. Also today

- **Web 1.7.44** — the top nav's category menus were clipped out of existence on
  the full-width bar (`overflow-hidden` on the header row vs Nav's `absolute
  top-full` panel); fixed with `overflow-x-clip`, which was measured in Chromium
  to leave the fold's `scrollWidth` reading identical. Review-page time columns
  went `w-14` → `w-16` (measured: `10:47 PM` is 57.8px against 56px). The agents
  page now always lists the two most recent stables, which a fast beta line had
  pushed off the list entirely.
- **Agent 3.6.48** (`beta`, `v2.6.9-beta.10`, installer verified attached) — the
  crash review's driver-churn verdict now prints the dgVoodoo2 URL, both
  filenames and the destination. A member lost an evening hunting the Zeal repo
  for files that were never in it.
- **`eqgame.exe` @ `0x004E138A` identified** as the client failing to survive a
  graphics-driver reset — see `RUNBOOK-client-crash-triage.md`.

## Open — read this first

| Item | Where it stands | Next |
|---|---|---|
| **Understand-Anything** | **assessed 2026-09-21 (§1), not adopted.** Overlaps `scripts/graphify.sh`, which already owns the deterministic half by decision; the LLM layer answers 1 of the 4 problems that test was built on, and that one is a grep | the guild lead's call on the bounded trial: run `/understand` against `packages/wolfpack-logsync/` **from a desktop session**, diff its tour against `HOW-ITS-BUILT.md`. Output is a draft for a human, never a committed authority. No auto-update hook, no `curl \| bash` |
| Crash reports are opt-in and OFF by default | open — a Mimic user can read a perfect local diagnosis while our table has nothing, which is why 2026-09-20 was triaged off screenshots | consider defaulting the toggle on, or prompting once after a raider's first crash |
| Crash review headline says "inside the EverQuest client" when the same dump shows GPU churn | open | for an `eqgame.exe` fault with driver churn, say the driver reset and the client could not survive it |
| ⚠ `scripts/` missed by the 2026-09-16 name sweep | open — `read-minidump.py` (prose ×2), `mimic-netdiag.ps1` (prose **and** user-facing output), `gen_screenshots.py` (bakes a name into published screenshots). `test-archive-merge.sh` is fixture DATA and stays | sweep the three; treat `gen_screenshots.py` like the `OverlayDemo` swap |
| `beta.yml` vs `latest.yml` | observation 2026-09-21 — `CLAUDE.md`'s channel table says Windows beta publishes `beta.yml`; beta.8/9/10 all publish `latest.yml`, and beta.9's has 163 downloads, so the channel demonstrably works | doc looks stale, not the build. Confirm next time the release workflow is open |
